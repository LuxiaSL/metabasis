"""A8 Leg-6 / Item 1 — the L4-c letter, UN-PARKED.

THE UNPARK (CP-0 finding, 2026-07-23). Leg-4F parked this letter because the whitened
target could not be built from banked inputs. Two of its three named blockers dissolve:

  1. "No banked class means." The letter's object needs unit(Sigma^-1 . Delta-mu), and
     Delta-mu enters ONLY through a positive scalar: V3raw is banked as
     unit(mu_analogical - mu_contrastive) with raw_norm recorded, so
     unit(Sigma^-1 Delta-mu) == unit(Sigma^-1 . V3raw) IDENTICALLY, sign included.
     Class means were never actually required.
  2. "The 2026-07-19 whiten build wrote stamps only, no vectors npz." The npz exists —
     node-side, under battery/a5_vectors_dsv2_lite_v3whiten{,_dir0}/, not under
     arms/A5_dsv2/whiten*/ where Leg-4F looked. It carries **V3w_L18** built to exactly
     the stamped recipe: unit(Sigma^-1(mu_analogical - mu_contrastive)), Sigma =
     Ledoit-Wolf, shrinkage logged, n_pos/n_neg = 160/160, on the dir0 mode pair.

So the letter reads on the BANKED object, at its own recipe. No Sigma re-derivation, no
substitution, no amendment. The fresh Sigma@L18 capture the baton specifies runs BESIDE
this (a8_leg6_l4c_sigma_beside.py) as the corpus- and convention-independent replication.

CONVENTION TRAP, NAMED (rake): vmb_a5_covariance_screen computes a RIDGE-regularized
sample Sigma (ridge = 1e-3 * mean eigenvalue), NOT Ledoit-Wolf. A fresh capture therefore
builds a DIFFERENT-convention object than the recipe this letter freezes. That is why the
banked LW object is primary and the fresh capture is a beside, not a replacement.

VINTAGE AMBIGUITY, CARRIED (the Leg-4F rake, now with its L18 face): two builds share the
recipe string and the mode pair but differ in shrinkage —
  a5_vectors_dsv2_lite_v3whiten       L18: lw_shrinkage .2577, cos_delta_whitened .1044
  a5_vectors_dsv2_lite_v3whiten_dir0  L18: lw_shrinkage .1205, cos_delta_whitened .3933
Both are read. Neither is silently preferred; the desk rules which is the object.

IDENTITY CHECK FIRST (no-peeking discipline): the same g and same source vector against
the RAW target must reproduce the banked number of record, cos = -.0865 (Leg-3 curve
rows, dsv2 dir0 cliff). Only if that reproduces does the whitened swap mean anything —
the raw->whitened contrast is then the ONLY thing that changed.

UNSTAMPED (C section 8). No P is self-scored here; the desk scores P8-L4c (.35).
