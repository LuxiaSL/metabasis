"""A8 Leg-6 / Item 3 — orthogonalized field-basis composition (P8-PERP .50).

The L4-b successor. L4-b's Reading A summed cos(u, dial_i) x dial_i-effect over a dial set
that is badly non-orthogonal (cos(Vconf, V7) ~ -.91 in both dense targets), so Reading A
double-counts the shared V7/Vconf component by construction and Reading B (Gram-corrected
least squares) was filed beside it. add-4 asks the obvious repair: orthogonalize the dial
basis against V7 first, then re-predict.

CONSTRUCTION IS STAMPED BEFORE ANY RE-PREDICTION (add-4's explicit requirement). It is
written to the readout's `construction` block and logged before a single ratio is computed.

TWO CONSTRUCTIONS, BOTH REPORTED — add-4 says "sequentially orthogonalized against V7",
which admits two readings, and this arm's standing practice (the Reading A/B precedent,
and the rules the previous three ambiguities bought) is to report every defensible one
rather than silently pick:

  P  "perp-to-V7"      : every non-V7 dial is Gram-Schmidt'd against V7 ALONE. The dials
                         stay mutually oblique; only the V7 double-count is removed.
  Q  "full sequential" : ordered Gram-Schmidt over [V7, Vrep_perp, Veos_perp, Vconf,
                         Vtemp] — a genuinely orthonormal basis. "Sequential Gram-Schmidt"
                         as a term of art.

BANKED PERP FORMS ARE USED WHERE THEY EXIST, AND NAMED: Vrep_perp and Veos_perp are
already banked Gram-Schmidt-against-V7 objects (the 8B forms carry cos-to-V7 ~ 4e-17 per
the fire log). Under construction P they are therefore passed through UNCHANGED, and the
readout says so per dial. Only Vconf and Vtemp are actually re-orthogonalized under P.

EFFECTS ARE CONVENTION-CARRIED, NOT RE-MEASURED (add-4's conditional: "P8-PERP inherits
the L4-b fork — convention-carried terms named, never freshly measured mid-session"). The
banked dose-ladder of each dial is attached to that dial's ORTHOGONALIZED form. This is a
substitution and it is named: the ladders were measured on the original vectors. For
Vrep_perp/Veos_perp under P the substitution is vacuous (vector unchanged); for Vconf,
Vtemp, and everything under Q it is real.

THE NEAR-ZERO ROW, reported beside as add-4 requires: 8b->qwen Vrep_perp at +0.3, whose
Leg-4F Reading-A prediction was -.0359 against obs -.0529 (ratio 1.472, within x2). A
near-zero prediction landing inside x2 is fragile — it can flip sign under any basis
change — so its behaviour under P and Q is reported explicitly rather than folded into
the count.

BAR (add-4, symmetric): Qwen >=4/5 within x2 AND 8B >=4/5 within x2, aggregation >=4/5
per sheet. NOT self-scored — the desk scores P8-PERP.
