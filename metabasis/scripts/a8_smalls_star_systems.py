"""A8 extension-pairs smalls — THE STAR SYSTEMS, one per (template-arm x family).

The desk's arm-consistency rule (Luxia, 2026-07-23): a star constant belongs to the
system it was solved in. The native-arm constants of record (c_3B=.6382, c_8B=.7545,
c_Qwen=.4730, c_DSV2=.4415 at k128) are NATIVE-ARM numbers. Any model whose fits are
raw-arm-only — OLMo has no chat template, so its native arm does not exist — must take
its constant from a PARALLEL RAW-ARM SYSTEM, derived from the already-banked raw-arm
a_hat rows. Slotting a raw-arm a_hat into the native-arm system would be the
family-mixing sin one level up, and family-mixing has already authored two false scores
in this arm (rakes 40, 14).

This script builds every system that closes, from banked fits only. ZERO GPU COMPUTE.

The algebra. Star model: a_hat(A->B) = c_A . c_B. With models {3B, 8B, Qwen, DSV2} the
three hub pairs (3B-8B, 8B-Qwen, 8B-DSV2) leave the system underdetermined; the direct
3B->Qwen fit (Leg-4E) closes it:

    c_3B^2  = a(3B->8B) . a(3B->Qwen) / a(8B->Qwen)
    c_8B    = a(3B->8B)  / c_3B
    c_Qwen  = a(8B->Qwen)/ c_8B
    c_DSV2  = a(8B->DSV2)/ c_8B

3B->DSV2 is then a PREDICTION, and Leg 6 measured it — so every system printed here
carries its own out-of-sample check, and a system whose check fails is not a system you
may hang a new constant on. Reported per (arm, family); families are never mixed inside
one equation (rake 40) and the rank guard k <= n_train/1.2 is applied per pair, since
n_train differs across legs (600 hub, 360 for the Leg-4E closer).

UNSTAMPED (C section 8). Scores nothing; this is the substrate for A8-add-7's
predictions, which are filed BEFORE any new pair is fitted.
