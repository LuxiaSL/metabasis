"""A8 Leg-6 / Item 5 — reverse behavioral certification (P8-REV .75): injection bank.

The arm has never steered the SOURCE-side model. Every behavioral leg so far pushed a
vector FORWARD (3B->8B, 8B->Qwen, 8B->DSV2, and the owl's Qwen->8B which is reverse but
into a target that had also been a forward target). This leg carries 8B's V7 BACK into
3B through the transpose of the banked Leg-0 anchor Procrustes and asks whether it
writes 3B's entropy on the standard frame.

CONSTRUCTION (add-5, frozen):
  * map        = REVERSE of the Leg-0 anchor fit fit_3bL14__8bL16_native_proc_k512
                 (TransportMap.transport(..., direction="rev") — the adjoint; for
                 Procrustes this is the exact inverse of the orthogonal part).
                 Procrustes is the family of record for reverse-direction claims (rake-15).
  * vector     = 8B V7_L16 (a5_vectors_8b_b7), sign-anchored through read_transported_axes.load_axes
                 BEFORE transport (standing rule: sign-anchor before ANY banked vector use).
  * controls   = the REVERSE-TRANSPORTED R band: 8B's own banked Rband1-3 carried back
                 through the SAME map. Native 3B R cells would not be the right control —
                 the question is whether the TRANSPORT carries signal, so the control must
                 travel the same road. add-5 pre-authorises fresh cells for exactly this.
  * doses      = +-{.03, .1, .3} x 3B's per-token median residual norm at L14, plus an
                 alpha=0 baseline. Full signed ladder (the SCOPE clause: monotone across
                 the whole signed ladder, sign flipping through zero).
  * n          = 80/cell (20 topics x 4 stage-0 strata x 1 seed), max_new_tokens 512,
                 attn eager, bare system prompt — the standard entropy frame.

NORM CONVENTION, NAMED: alpha uses the a5 stamps' per-token median residual norm
(L14 = 12.2391), which is the convention every prior behavioral leg used. The A8 leg-0
collection stamp carries a slightly different number for the same site (12.1125) because
it is measured over the A8 corpus rather than the a5 stage-0 pool. The a5 number is used;
the other is recorded beside so the difference is visible rather than silent.

IDENTITY CHECK before anything is written: cos(g_rev . V7_8B, V7_3B) must reproduce the
banked Leg-0 REVERSE read (+.531). If it does not, the leg parks with the trace.
