"""A8 Leg-6 — THE MODE-PAIR AUDIT: which contrast does each banked DSV2 needle carry?

Item 1 found that the arm's `dir0` is [analogical, contrastive] in 3B and 8B but
[linear, socratic] in the DSV2 plain bank, and that two banked "whitened V3" vintages
share a provenance string while being mutually near-orthogonal. That was established from
stamps plus cross-vintage cosines. This script settles it from a THIRD, INDEPENDENT
source: a contrast computed directly from the A8 Leg-2 DSV2 state bank, whose per-text
mode labels come from the corpus manifest and owe nothing to any vector build.

For each site and each candidate mode pair, Delta-mu = mean(S3 pos) - mean(S3 neg) over
the leg-2 native state bank, then cosine against every banked needle object. A vector
that carries a given contrast should align with that contrast's corpus-derived direction
and not with the other's.

Capture-convention caveat, stated: the corpus contrast is per-TEXT mean states over the
A8 corpus (n=60/pole); the banked vectors were built from per-TOKEN positions over
dedicated pole runs (n=160/class). Different captures of the same intended object agree
in direction but not in magnitude — the Leg-4F exploratory saw the same ~.2 scale. Read
the CONTRAST between the two columns, not the absolute value of either.

UNSTAMPED (C section 8). Scores nothing; it is evidence for a desk ruling.
