"""A8 Leg-6 / Item 2 — the star factorization's FOURTH NODE (P8-STAR .50).

The star model says every pair's attenuation factors through per-model constants:
    a_hat(A->B) = c_A . c_B
Three banked pairs (3B<->8B .514, 8B<->Qwen .332, 8B<->DSV2 .266) leave the system
underdetermined; it closes on a_hat_direct(3B->Qwen) from L4-e. The k128 closure
reproduces add-4's filed constants exactly:
    c_3B = .6838, c_8B = .7517, c_Qwen = .4417, c_DSV2 = .3539
and predicts the one pair never fitted:  a_hat(3B->DSV2) = .2420, band [.19, .29].

This reads that pair for the first time. 3B was replayed over the LEG-2 corpus (the same
texts the DSV2 bank was built from, sha-verified byte-identical), giving paired states on
shared text; the fit grid then runs exactly as every other leg's.

RANK GUARD: n_train = 600, so k <= 600/1.2 = 500 and **k512 is rank-forbidden** on this
pair. The letter anticipated this ("proc at the rank-guarded k, k128 expected"), so k128
is the primary family here. Full panel reported beside, because the three INPUT a_hat's
are k512 reads — that is the filed family-mixing caveat, and it deserves to be visible
rather than asserted.

PANEL BESIDE (reported, unscored): the field axes and dir0. The dir0 row is the free
context add-4 asked for — does the MoE needle cliff reproduce from a DIFFERENT source
family? It is read three ways, because Leg-6 Item 1 established that the arm's dir0 is
not the same mode contrast on both sides:
  * vs the plain-bank V3_L18   — PAIR-MISMATCHED (3B dir0 = analogical/contrastive,
                                 DSV2 plain V3 = linear/socratic). This is the
                                 construction the banked cliff used.
  * vs v3whiten RAW L18        — PAIR-MATCHED, unwhitened.
  * vs v3whiten WHITENED L18   — PAIR-MATCHED and whitened (the L4-c letter's object).

UNSTAMPED (C section 8). No P self-scored — the desk scores P8-STAR.
